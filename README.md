# ✖️⭕ Tic Tac Toe – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** (X & O) game for two players, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's part of my hands-on learning during the **DevWeekend Fellowship** 🚀.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Kaniz Sukayna**, a beginner web developer on a journey to explore how websites work. This game helped me learn how to build grids, handle user clicks, and add win/draw logic using JavaScript.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For creating the game board layout.
- **CSS3** – For styling the grid and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** – For game logic like turns, win checks, and reset.

## 🗂 Files in This Project

- `index.html` – Page layout and structure.
- `style.css` – Styling for the board and cells.
- `script.js` – Handles turns, game logic, and win/draw checks.

## 🔧 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Two players take turns clicking on empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 in a row wins!
4. You can refresh or reset the game to play again.

## 🌱 What I Learned

- Grid layout with CSS
- DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript
- Writing simple but clean game logic
- Improving UI feedback on clicks
